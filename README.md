# Vat

Vat is a cross-platform tool for managing software packages. Inspired by [Rez](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/rez), but with a focus on simplicity and ease of use.


The package versions are managed using `git tag`.


## The Basics
- `vat init` - Initialize a new package in the current directory.
- `vat repo-init` - Initialize a new repository in the current directory.
- `vat up` - Update the package to the latest version.
- `vat publish` - Publish the package to the repository.
- `vat test <command>` - Run the tests for the current package.
